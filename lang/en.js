      "The Family that originally built it was undoubtedly sensitive to its architectural shape and a keen sense of solidity and elegance, which can still be seen today in the original granite walls, high ceilings, riga staircase and wild pine wood floors. It is the natural light that guides our guests to the garden of camellias. In this green, secret oasis, with ancient trees and birds, life unfolds peacefully.",
